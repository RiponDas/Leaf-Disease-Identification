# Leaf-Disease-Identification

## The main objective of this project is to train the machine to predict the disease. Plant disease will be basically identified by observing different patterns on the parts of the plant. The disease part is detected through image processing and machine learning.

## The system design mainly consists of 
### 1) Image collection 
### 2) Image Preprocessing 
### 3) Image segmentation 
### 4) Feature extraction 
### 5) Training
### 6) Classification using Multiclass SVM

### The available dataset devided in following 5 classes. 1)Alternaria Alternata 2)Anthracnose 3)Bacterial Blight 4)Cercospora Leaf Spot  5)Healthy Leaves.
